Woodhouse Slack Interface
==================
This module allows you to contact Woodhouse using Slack. You will need to [add a bot user integration](https://slack.com/services/new/bot) for this to work.

## Installation

* Clone the this repo into the interfaces directory.
* `npm install` within the cloned directory
* If Woodhouse isn't already started, start it and skip to the last step
* If you have the shell interface enabled (enabled by default), run `load modules`, otherwise restart Woodhouse
* Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), navigate to the interface page and select the Hangouts interface. Fill in the api token, check the enabled box and click save.
